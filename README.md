# Dice-Roll

This is a dice roll program I made using python. The way it works is simple, the program will ask you how many dice would you like to roll 1 or 2, once chosen the program will then run and choose random numbers between 1 and 6 and then display it.

To use the program you will need to have python installed and run it in your terminal
